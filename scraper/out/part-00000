1	I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their "leader" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.||Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp. Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.||Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there. One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll. When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out. I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula. It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background. However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it. The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up. The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more. Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast. They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines. Most of the adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog. They are funny and are very well used. In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads. Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film. It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands. However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly. The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults. Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more). A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by. The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!||Toy Story 5/5 stars Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real What if they could talk Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely. 'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities. What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever. Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good. The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' 'Toy Story' 1 &amp; 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films not sequels by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.||This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too. When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides. The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as "Woody" and Allen as "Buzz Armstrong," I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc. Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed "winner" as is the sequel.||Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.||Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.||Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and "plastic corrosion awareness meetings," until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops "in the field" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect them. There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger. Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from Cheers), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), Toy Story is that rara avis that succeeds on all levels in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the "real people") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse. The "Disney Movie" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, Toy Story somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field. Sure, there are "messages," but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, "Clearly I will go sailing no more," launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's ide fixe of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost. Buzz who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of "playing inert" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as "Mrs. Nesbitt"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, "This is not flying - this is falling with style," simply seals this movie's greatness. At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.||A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent.||Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped. "Toy Story" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else. The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when "Toy Story" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that "Kelly's Heroes" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast. Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines ("I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school"), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated "Galaxy Quest." While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. "A Bug's Life" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, "Toy Story" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it. I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of "the claw." If it reached for pathos a little less often, "Toy Story" would be an undeniable classic. As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially) the inner ones.||Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year). Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.||"I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified." Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer. Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the "real world of toys". Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the "chosen ones", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. "Nirvana is coming!" the aliens whisper, watching as the "chosen ones" are airlifted to their deaths. Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is "just an ordinary toy" who "can not fly". "Flying" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the "flesh" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become "something more". Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. "I am not a toy!" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump a literal leap of faith and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly. Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living Why do anything What's the point And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick ("Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches"). Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not "up in the skies". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us. Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the "greater good of his family" quite literally giving him wings. In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the "moral code" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: "To Infinity and Beyond!" 8.9/10 With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, "Toy Story" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since "Snow White". Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, "The Incredibles". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.||This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song "You've Got a Friend" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!||When Toy Story came, in 1995,I was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation;Pixar wasn't famous like today, and we didn't have movies like Shrek and Finding Nemo. But I have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics. Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him. Looking what he did, Woody goes search Buzz and them many adventures happen.||With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood. The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move. Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort. Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining.||I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted. This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since "Snow White." Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney. Its an iconic turning point, like "Citizen Kane," "2001," "Bonnie and Clyde," Greenaway's "Tempest." (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until "Nemo." But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is "Wall-E.") The business about family and desired roles are not "the point" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.||It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script. Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home. Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry. The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays.||I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters. With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.||I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that "Toy Story" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90 chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of "Toy Story's" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new "it" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit "Finding Nemo" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, "Toy Story" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love "Toy Story," and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too. 10/10||Toy Story is a good film about friendship..... that didn't suck. It is the story of toys that come alive (because it's technically a Disney movie). One of the toys is a cowboy doll named Woody. He is Andy's (the kid) favorite toy, until his birthday when he gets a Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger toy. The weird thing is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy, and he becomes Andy's favorite toy. Buzz and Woody get lost and they have to get back to Andy's before he moves. That's all I can say about the film without saying a spoiler. Toy Story changed the way of animation. I didn't think the animation in The Lion King was amazing even though I really liked it. After I watched this, I watched a live action version of this on YouTube. The live action version was a little better..... sorry. At the end Toy Story is a good film. No need to get the cloning device. 8.3/10||This movie is at least 18 years old and still is able to capture young audiences from around the world. How did Pixar do it How did they create a movie that has one of the greatest story lines to it Who knows but I'm sure that Dreamworks will never be able to top it. Not once. By the way, if you have not already seen this movie my only question is "how" Almost every living body has seen this movie it's alive and it's active yet you still have not seen it Wow, you most indeed live one depressing life. Anyways, even if you have watched this movie you should already know that it's good but if you just wanted to see reviews fine by me, but don't come yelling at me if you don't agree with what I'm saying, it's pointless.||A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room. This was the movie that made Pixar a major studio, and I could certainly see why it could, as this movie is a work of art, a HUGE work of art! Toy Story is honestly one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, it's funny, it's moving, it's touching, and it's unforgettable! I give this movie two very big thumbs up, and I put them WAAAAAAAYYYYY UP! This was the first full-length computer animated movie, and it would later set the stage for many more to come, such as A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, and many, many, many, many, many, more to follow. I'll give this movie a rating of ten out of ten, as it is a groundbreaking movie that would inspire a generation of animated movies that still continues to this very day! I am so glad that I watched it, as I was not disappointed by it in any possible way, shape, or form, it's truly a remarkable movie, it's one of the best animated movies of all time, and one of the best movies of all time! In addition to the groundbreaking computer animation, the voice acting is stellar. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did fabulous jobs at voicing Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively. They were perfect for those roles, I especially loved it when Tim Allen (As Buzz) said: "You are a sad, strange, little man, and you have my pity." That is one of the funniest lines in the movie. There are a lot of really funny lines in this movie, but there are too many to list. As far as Pixar goes, this was the movie that started it all. Pixar may have made a few things before 1995, but it was Toy Story that made them a major studio, and their long and glorious animation career was off and running. I've also seen Toy Story 2, which is also a marvelous movie, and considering all of what I've heard, I'll have to see Toy Story 3. All in all, this is one film series in which I can say that has not suffered from sequels, in fact, they get better as time goes on. I can't believe that I waited so incredibly long to see this fabulous animated movie, as it is one only one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, it is one one of the best movies that I have ever seen, it's groundbreaking. As far as animated movies go, this is in a class by itself, it defines the meaning of the words, animated movie. Is it a movie that requires viewing Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is! It's a movie that is great for the whole family. Unlike a lot of the stuff that comes out nowadays, this movie, along with Toy Story 2 and 3 is not a movie that is geared strictly towards children. As there are some jokes and gags in this movie that only older audiences would recognize. Get ready for a movie that will absolutely blow you away, that's the animated spectacular, Toy Story! It delivers loads of enjoyment for both kids and parents, meaning that it gives plenty of enjoyment for children, and their parents will love it too. Toy Story is as great as most Pixar productions get, don't miss it! 10/10||Pixar has an impeccable filmography, but even with ten films, Pixar's first animated film still it's best one. This movie show some kind of magic, that I can't explain, and just fascinates me. Revolutionary, "Toy Story" was the first of all the great 3D animated movie. It's voice casting is just perfect, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen give memorable performances (Like the scene where Woody yells at Buzz "You are a toy!") making this movie unforgettable. The animation itself is great, although nowadays animated movies are a little bit better animated. The songs in this film are moving and exciting sometimes, witch gives a beautiful touch to the movie. But that's not the best part of it. The problems and dilemmas that the characters experience, are so good, that it may sound a little too complex to a kid's movie, the fact that buzz can't be real astronaut and that he has to settle with being just a toy is just brilliant, and like I said before, uncommonly intelligent. And also the situation where Woody has to prove his "Ex-friends" that he didn't kill Buzz, that is for me what makes this film different than any other animated film ("UP" also has an intelligent plot, but the execution is not as good as this one). Verdict: Magical, touching, and quite brilliant, "Toy Story" is a lot of fun.||Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like "Buzz LightBeer" can have quite an impact. Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100 perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved.||The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word "play" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing. So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift. It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People. None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store. These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best.||Toy Story is a gem of a movie from Pixar that is still as visually impressive today as it was when it was originally released over a decade ago. Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while. Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive. Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic. 9 out of 10.||As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal!||Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more.||Meet Sheriff Woody, a cowboy doll who is the favorite of his owner, Andy Davis. Andy has many toys: the surly Mr. Potatohead, Hamm the sarcastic piggy bank, dinosaur "Nervous" Rex, and Slinky Dog. Also, Andy has a Little Bo Peep lamp Bo is in love with Woody. REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS SO IT MAY SPOIL THE FILM FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT (IF THERE ARE ANY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT) Andy's family is moving away so they throw his birthday party the week before the move. The toys are worried that they might get replaced, but Woody sends the plastic soldiers to see the presents. Soon, the new toy arrives. It's the coolest and hottest toy on the market today, Buzz Lightyear! Andy loves it. Woody and the others take a friendly approach to Buzz and they all like him, except for Woody who has a run-in with the green eyed monster, so to speak. Buzz is a toy but he's under the delusion that he's a real space man. Woody grows very jealous of Buzz and they say mean spirited things to one another, and witness Andy's neighbor, Sid, a bad little boy who tortures toys, for fun! That night, Andy and his mom are going to dinner at Pizza Planet and Andy can bring one toy with him. Woody knows it's gonna be Buzz, so Woody attempts to knock Buzz behind the chest of drawers, but accidentally knocks him out the window. The other toys find Woody guilty but before they can take action, Andy takes Woody in the car instead. At the gas station, Buzz meets up with Woody and they fight, while Andy and Mom drive off to Pizza Planet, leaving them alone in the empty dark gas station. Buzz is mad that Woody delayed his rendevouz with Star Command and Woody is upset because he's lost, but he soon finds hope, for pulling into the gas station was the infamous Pizza Planet delivery truck with YO on the back and a plastic rocket on the roof. Buzz climbs up front and Woody hides in the "cargo bay" and get's mashed by a tool box. They arrive at Pizza Planet and Buzz looks for a space ship to transport him home, he climbs into a claw machine shaped like a rocket and Woody goes in to save him, but soon they're won by none other than Sid!! They go to Sid's house and are almost eaten up by his dog, Scud. They venture into Sid's room where disfigured toys live and toy body parts are everywhere. Before long, Buzz witnesses a commercial for the Buzz Lightyear action figure and he discovers he was a toy the whole time. Not only that, but he can't fly. He attempted it and broke his arm right off. Sid's sister Molly found him, tied him in an apron and called him Mrs. Nesbit. Woody still attempts to get home to the guys, and uses Buzz's broken arm to prove their friends, but they see through the disguise and still think Woody's a murderer. And to add insult to injury, Sid got a rocket in the mail. A rocket that blows things up. Luckily some disfigured toys repaired Buzz's arm, but Sid straps the rocket to Buzz, next morning it would be all over for him. Though the rainy night, Woody convices Buzz that being a toy is much better than being a space ranger. Buzz gains confidence and helps out, but soon is captured by Sid. Woody seeks the aid of the toys in Sid's room and they make a plan. Woody comes alive in front of Sid, who is now completely terrified of toys. But before Woody can take off the rocket, Andy and Mom are driving off with the moving van. They run into Scud which is a delay for Buzz, but Woody climbs into the van, unloads a remote controlled car and rescues Buzz, but Woody is thrown overboard and now he and Buzz have to catch up. The car batteries die, but they have the rocket. Woody lights it and they fly off, they return the car into the van (unfortunately for Mr. Potatohead who goes to pieces, literally). Buzz opens his wings just as they head into the air and the rockets explodes, and Buzz actually flies!! They make it to Andy's new home and soon it's Christmas. Buzz is somewhat worried but Woody assures him, "What could Andy possibly get that is worse than you" Answer: a dog. Good film!! Great animation, good story. Followed by a good sequel!! -------||I avoided this movie for a long time- in fact, I only ended up seeing it due to the influence of alt.video.laserdisc. I am forever indebted to this movie for re-igniting interest in Tron (my sentimental favorite movie of-all-time); but besides this, TS is an incredibly entertaining movie in its own right. I was familiar with Pixar animation before TS; I actually stayed away from this movie because I didn't want to have my opinions altered by the presence of Disney. I now wish I had seen this movie years ago, instead of waiting for a cheap LD clearance sale. TS, while adhering to Disney movie traditions, is an entertaining diversion, and historically important as a computer-rendered movie to boot. The difference between Disney and Pixar sensibilities concerning humor are evident early on; one is thankful that Disney gave so much lee-way to Pixar concerning story and dialogue. While I can't say that I was as entertained by the goings-on as average Disney fans, I can say that the results are much better than standard Disney fare. (In fact, if you can find this for under $50 on laserdisc, I can assure that your entertainment dollar is well-spent) The LD contains the pre-TS Pixar shorts (worth the price of admission) as well as director's comments, and much more. The LD is probably the best deal I've had in a while, and I recommend that everyone- despite their feelings towards Disney- get this LD set. I hope that Disney comes out with an equivalent set for DVD users; everyone deserves to have access to this. An amazing film, seemingly light-years beyond what Disney is capable of. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.||Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love.||"Toy Story" is one of the best children's films ever. It's cute and funny, and Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are hilarious! All of the toys are very funny, and the movie is sure pleasure! A family hit! I give it a 10 out of 10!||As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs!||"Toy Story" is a real sight to behold because it is the first feature-length, computer-animated film. Once you get passed the amazing visual effects, you see a really great film that works because of interesting characters and a second-to-none screenplay. Even the roughest of critics would have trouble finding problems with this winner. 5 stars out of 5.||You may or may not like "Toy Story", but there's something that's perfectly clear: it changed for good the animation cinema. Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults. I do prefer movies such as "Antz" or "Shrek", but I think "Toy story" is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the "Disney touch" and all those awful songs... So, after "Toy story" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema. My rate: 6/10||A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances.||I didn't see this until recently and it might have a lot to do with this show just being older now but the movie didn't look very good, the effects were all pretty out of date. I'm sure they were good at the time but they really don't hold up. The story was just OK and very predictable even for a children's movie. I liked some of the one liners but there wasn't much point for me in watching this, I didn't enjoy it and knew everything that was going to happen. It also probably didn't help that I am not a fan of Tom Hanks or the Tool Time guy (Tim Allen) who did the voice of Buzz Lightyear. Saw the other Toy Story movies first and didn't like them very much either. Maybe I am just a stick in the mud!||With innovation painted in every single frame of this blazingly original &amp; undeniably entertaining film, Toy Story isn't only hailed as a revolutionary animation feature for its breathtaking technical achievements but also for its meticulous mastery in storytelling. With a greater emphasis on story &amp; its characters, also not to be missed its clever use of wit &amp; homages, perfect voice cast, and a heartwarming score, all of which work in perfect harmony and is subsequently taken to an entirely new standard of animation filmmaking with its breathtaking use of computer animation, an accomplishment that not only changed the course of the entire animation industry but also re-invented &amp; established Pixar as the first revolutionary animation studio in the history of Hollywood cinema industry since Walt Disney and commenced its remarkable journey as the most respected and critically &amp; commercially excelling film studio of the current era.||This movie was great and very enjoyable, my whole family loved the scenes and the summary. Every moment was hilarious and lovable, while all scenes were playing you could feel the relationship between Woody and buzz growing and growing and at the end it reaches the height of a giant tree and as sweet as a majestic day. Most of the movie was about how friends should stick together and how bad it gets when the separate from each other and it takes several days, years etc till there relationship sticks back together. I really appreciate the efforts which Disney production put in to make a wonderful movie and here it is shown in every role and screen play. Special thanks to all the people who took part in making this happy film!!.||I very fondly remember watching this film as a child and to this day it it still one of Pixar's finest efforts, especially if it's their first feature-length animation. As for the animation, it is pretty impressive for 1995 and the most realistically-modelled toys are Etch-A-Sketch and Mr Potato Head, although the main toys Woody and Buzz are well-designed as well. There are some funny moments such as Mr Potato Head pretending to be a Picasso painting and Sid's sister Hannah dressing Buzz up as a woman and naming him Mrs Nesbitt at a tea party as well as some dark, sinister moments such as Sid making mutant toys that eventually scare him off and the tense moment of Woody and Buzz's rivalry including the memorable, "You are a toy!" line. Other lines I remember from this film are Buzz's catchphrase "To infinity and beyond" and Woody's many phrases such as "You're my favourite deputy" and "There's a snake in my boots" to name just two. The opening scene involving Andy playing with Woody accompanied by Randy Newman's 'You've Got A Friend In Me' is one of the film's most captivating parts and I liked the product placement of toy manufacturers (Rex being made by Mattel and Mr Potato Head being made by Playskool). Overall, this is a dark and funny start to my favourite trilogy of animated films. 10/10.
2	Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun. The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects. Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy. Are there annoying things in this movie Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining. Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!||There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has.||I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me!||There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that "I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes "In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight" Jumanji "Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more" Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing)||You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it. Oh and one more thing: from "Jumanji", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.||Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play. But remember: once you start this game, you can't stop. If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things. Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added. Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself. He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing. The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams! Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles. He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt. The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type. The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the "This is MY baby" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page). Highly recommended for old and young alike.||The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.||I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.||I just used to love "Jumanji" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy "Jumanji". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with. Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter You'll just have to wait and see. This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy "Jumanji"! 8/10||Another of my favorite childhood movies, there is Jumanji,one of my favorite movies with Robin Willians and Kirsten Dunst. Alan Parrish is a rich boy and his family were the founders of the city of New England, where the boy and his family lives. Not only that, his father is a businessman who has lots of deals and one of them is the notable shoe factory. But Alan life is not so good as we think: he is having problems with her best friend Sarah's boyfriend and his gang and his father wants to send him to a boarding school. Angry, he says to his father that he is never going to talk to him again and will ran away from his home. But when Alan was going to scape from his house, his friend Sarah goes to his house to talk, and they end up playing the mysterious game called Jumanji that Alan found buried. The strange game starts, and many strange things like wild animals start to show up, until Alan enter the game and be confined there until the results of the dice be 5 or 8. Sarah, too afraid to continue playing,run away. After 26 years,two brothers named Judy and Peter found the game and start playing it, like Sarah and Alan 26 years ago. Peter takes 5 in the dice, what makes Alan turn back after many years. Now they need to finish the game in order to all the horrible results end, but first Alan needs to find Sarah and convince her to play the spooky game again.||The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family. Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library. At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as "realistic" as in other computer generated animated films. That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real. The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together. Have fun. Read the book. Watch the movie. Play the game.||In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called "Jumanji", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like "Dead Poet's Society" or "Good Morning, Vietnam"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bte noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the "Narnia" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in "Jumanji" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of "alternative timelines". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10||Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.||I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure!||Jumanji is a game that teaches you a lesson...If you start something you'd better be prepared to finish it. Thankfully, this is a movie in which that is easy to do. The premise, a game that produces real consequences (like a stampede of wild African animals, or a floor that turns into quicksand), is a fun way to introduce several exciting--sometimes hysterical, sometimes terrifying--circumstances for Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to have fun with, and fun it is, like a roller coaster at Six Flags. But in a way this film is also about growing up; about learning how to fit in, how to be responsible for yourself, and above all how perseverance can win the day. Yes, this is a fantasy-adventure movie. But there is a point to it all, and that point is that sticking to something in the face of terrible adversity has its own very special rewards. One last thing. This is supposed to be a Robin Williams movie. But good as he is, Jonathan Hyde as Hunter Van Pelt and David Alan Grier as Carl Bentley steal every scene they are in.||'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle onto the real world. Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real. Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away literally!!||Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.||Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.||Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid &amp; I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism &amp; magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh &amp; Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining &amp; magical. It offers humor, magic &amp; emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd &amp; Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!||While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox||This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are SPOILER guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!||If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite. As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy. The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be. And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it.||I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it.||As a child Williams is "captured" by bizarre jungle survival board game. He emerges 26 years later when the game is next played by two orphans. Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable. If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying.||"Jumanji" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game "jumanji" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy.||I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.||Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.||I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.||My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!||6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,,||On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it.||I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it!||Jumanji! based on the story's by Chris Van Allsburg Robin Williams is a blast! The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an 8 Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! 6.5 really, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... "kids" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the 6.5 it receives id like to see it reaching a 7.5 for entertainment value only!||This is the very best I've seen with Robin Williams. The movie has great cast, good acting, great special effects for its time, and an original, well told story. A family friendly fantasy action thriller. There is so much magic in the movie, it is so close and intense. It is full of great shots, great performances, where the actors, Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt in particular, but also all others including the child actors. Actually, Kirsten Dunst and Laura Bell Bundy are particularly impressive child actors with terrific presence. It does drag a bit sometimes, in sequences where you just wish the heroes would be more efficient, where you get a bit of a "oh no, not again" when the story gets delayed again by similar problems. This affects my rating a little bit, but most of the complications that delay the story are called for, so it isn't a great problem. The average action movie is a whole lot worse. Although the movie can be slightly scary for small children, it has no profanity whatsoever, some violence but no blood and gore. But it has a lot of humor, particularly visual humor, and much of it is actually funny. Very family friendly. I recommend it.||Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood clich but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2.||i have t say,this movie started out pretty slow,and i thought it was gonna be a dud.i'm glad i kept watching.it turned into a pretty good movie.if you're into action and adventure,you'll certainly find it in abundance here.there are some great action sequences,providing scads of excitement.but there are also a lot of very funny moments,and there's even a hint or 2 of romance.there are some fantastic creatures here.the only downside i can think of is the visual effects.i found them kinda cheesy,and sometimes they didn't quite look real.the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky,but other times were pretty realistic.but that's a small downside,since the movie is so much fun.Robin Williams is the featured performer here,but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific.Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well.but David Alan Grier was a riot.Kirsten Dunst was good too.overall, this is a good movie for both kids and adults.for me,Jumani is a 7/10||Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be "real", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as "Soulman" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the "adult" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal.||I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10.||beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head.||A most enjoyable surprise is this pure fantasy from special effects wiz Joe Johnston ("Honey I Shrunk the Kids" and "Adventures of the Rocketeer"). Story concerns the discovery of a mysterious board game by a young boy, Alan, in 1969. When he and his friend Sarah begin playing the game, they unleash forces beyond their control that propel Alan to another world and send Sarah running and screaming from the house. Twenty-six years later, young orphans Judy and Peter find the game in a dusty attic and begin playing themselves, once again releasing power they cannot contain. Johnston has a ball with the limitless f/x possibilities made available by this innovative premise (based on the novel). Computer graphics and animation is astounding, and though several images are obviously artificially generated, the impact is still markedly effective. Johnston constantly surprises, and will have you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding, from scene one to the dazzling finale. Wisely too, he has mixed in some romping fun and a good measure of humour, to make this a memorable fantasy-adventure. Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and the young support cast - led by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce - do very well, but all, including the usually dominant Williams, are outclassed by the visual expertise, which includes some impressive sets and art direction. Sound effects are also top notch. James Horner provides another thoroughly satisfying score to round everything off. One of the best, most imaginative films I've seen for some time. Saturday, April 6, 1996 - Village Morwell This wild, romping fantasy-adventure is a must for young and old alike. Special effects wiz Joe Johnston presents a film dominated by spectacular visual illusions, illusions which even manage to outshine the normally prominent Robin Williams. The plot does have similarities to "Back to the Future"', in that the board game gives the power to change history, as did the De Lorean in Robert Zemeckis' fantasy-adventure smash. Director Joe Johnston should really take full credit for fashioning this flick into a funny, frightening, full-on-fun-fest, with the undoubted help of an enjoyable cast (including Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, Jonathan Hyde and Bonnie Hunt) and an ingenious effects team. Music is from a very capable James Horner. Highly recommended for a return viewing, especially at the cinema. Friday, August 30, 1996 - Video
